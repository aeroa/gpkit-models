Compressible Aerodynamics
=========================

This module contains models for the lift and drag of wings, surfaces and fuselages in compressible airflow, i.e. at subsonic compressible, transonic and supersonic Mach numbers.

The `docs` folder contains documentation describing the derivation and validation of the models.
