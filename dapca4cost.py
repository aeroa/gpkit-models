	Cost Model from Raymer, Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach 3rd Edition, pp 713-714
	
	The total cost is Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Cost 

	Cost is in 2012 dollars

	Engineering hours considers all airframe, propulsion and avionics integration and design.
	It does not include engineering of avionics, propulsion, tooling or production planning. 

	Tooling hours covers all the preparation for production.  It also covers ongoing tooling cost
	through production. 

	Manufacturing hours is the direct labor to fabricate the aircraft. It also includes cost of 
	labor of subcontractors. 

	Quality Control hours covers all inspections. 

	Flight test cost covers all cost to prove airworthiness. 

	Manufacturing Materials is the raw materials cost and assumes that airframe 
	and main materials are made of aluminum.

	The Engine Cost assumes that the cost of the engine is not known.

	Uses 2012 pricing and economics

	Units are not included in variable definitions
	
	Labor Rates are found from Raymer
	Avionics rate taken from Raymer and based on 15% cost of unit
	Default values based on Honda Jet specs
	
	Arguments
	---------
	engine_discount : bool

	    By default, to keep the model GP it does not consider the discount applied per engine.
	    If the number of engines in the design is variable, set this to True and solve as a 
	    SignomialProgram.
